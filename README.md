Zero dependency Bitcoin math implementation in C

## Introduction

I started the `bitcoin_math` project in order to teach myself the basics of Bitcoin math from first principles, without having to wade through the source code of any of the crypto or "bignum" libraries on which standard Bitcoin implementations in Python depend.

My goal was to collect together a minimal set of functions in a single C source code file with no dependencies other than the following standard C libraries: `ctype.h`, `math.h`, `stdint.h`, `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`, and `time.h`.

Given a choice between efficiency and readability, I have opted for the latter, for example by avoiding inline functions and macros.

The result is `bitcoin_math.exe`, a simple menu driven console application which implements functions for the generation of mnemonic phrases, seeds, private keys, extended keys, public keys, and Bitcoin addresses using various cryptographic hash functions, arbitrary precision integer math, elliptic curve math, and radix conversions, all built from standard C data types and a few custom structs.

Wherever possible, hash digests, MACs, seeds, keys, and addresses are manipulated as arbitrary precision integers, reflecting their essentially numerical nature. These numbers are typically rendered onscreen in hex or Bitcoin base 58 format, but can be rendered in any base between 2 and 64 using the base conversion function.


## Getting started with `bitcoin_math` 

Compilation: The source code of bitcoin_math compiles with gcc under Windows using the following simple command:

`gcc -o bitcoin_math.exe bitcoin_math.c`

The compilation command works on Linux, although you may have to append `-lm` to ensure that the `math.h` functions `log10` and `log` are recognised. Note that the `system(cls);` command in the menu functions is not recognised by Linux, so non-fatal errors will be raised on execution.

I have found bitcoin_math.exe to be fast enough for its intended illustrative / educational purposes. However, it can be trivially speeded-up using compiler optimisation flags such as `-O3`. Conversion to a library should also be relatively simple. Obviously, many further improvements in efficiency are potentially available.

There are four menus, some with sub-menus:

**1. Master keys** This function takes 256 bits of random entropy (typed or pasted, in a specified base between 2 and 64) and generates the corresponding master private key, master chain code, and master public key (in compressed, uncompressed, and P2PKH formats). There is an option to generate "random" entropy. However, this option uses the standard C function `rand()` seeded using the current system time. As such, **IT IS HOPLESSLY INADEQUATE** as a source of cryptographically secure random entropy, and therefore must not be used to generate any Bitcoin addresses to which any coins will be sent!

**2. Child keys** These functions take a parent private key or public key and a corresponding parent chain code (typed or pasted, in hex only), together with a numerical index. Depending on the function chosen and the value range of the index, these functions output a normal or hardened child private key and corresponding child chain code, or a child public key.

**3. Base converter** This function takes a number of arbitrary length (typed or pasted) in any specified base between 2 and 64, and outputs a radix converted version of the number for each base between 2 and 64. Note that, in `bitcoin_math` base "2" corresponds to a binary representation with a space between each set of eight bits, whereas base "-2" corresponds to an unbroken binary string. Likewise, base "16" corresponds to lower case hex preceded by "0x", whereas base "-16" corresponds to upper case hex with no prefix. Finally, base "58" corresponds to Bitcoin base 58, whereas base "-58" corresponds to regular base 58.

**4. Functions** This menu enables some individual functions, including P2PKH serialisation, and Secp256k1 functions for point addition, point doubling, and scalar multiplication, to be independently executed. Parameters such as private keys, chain codes, and Secp256k1 coordinates must be typed or pasted in hex format.


## Acknowledgements

The BIP39 word list, and the source code for the cryptographic hash functions (RIPEMD160, SHA256, SHA512, HMAC-SHA512), were copied from various third party Github repositories, with a few minor modifications for readability e.g. conversion of inline functions into standalone functions.

The majority of the original source code in `bitcoin_math` relates to arbitrary precision integer math which is required to implement the elliptic curve functions used in Bitcoin to convert private keys into public keys.

This arbitrary precision integer math code was heavily influenced by the source code of the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library ("GMP", https://gmplib.org/), and DI Management Services' BigDigits multiple-precision arithmetic library (https://www.di-mgt.com.au/bigdigits.html).

My version of arbitrary precision integer division is adapted from the well known Hacker's Delight version, where the digits are processed in pairs of 16 bit integers ("half words") combined into 32 bit integers. I modified the code to use pairs of 8 bit integers combined into 16 bit integers in order to enable the uint8_t arrays that comprise the `bnz_t` digits to be consumed directly.

The algorithms for the elliptic curve functions were adapted from a paper entitled _Implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography in 'C'_ by Kuldeep Bhardwaj and Sanjay Chaudhary (International Journal on Emerging Technologies 3(2): 38-51 (2012)), which used GMP for the arbitrary precision integer functions. It was straightforward to adapt the algorithms to work with my own arbitrary precision integer math code.

The algorithms for the modular power and modular multiplicative inverse functions were adapted from the pseudocode provided in the corresponding Wikipedia pages.


## The source code

The source code file bitcoin_math.c is divided into the following sections:

### /* MISCELLANEOUS */
The BIP39 word list, formatted as a 2D array (2048 x 9) of type `char`, and a utility function (`init_uint8_array`) which initiates and zeroes a fixed length 1D dynamic array of type `uint8_t`.

### /* RIPEMD160 */
Standard cryptographic hash function with a 20 byte digest.

### /* SHA256 */
Standard cryptographic hash function with  32 byte digest.

### /* SHA512 */
Standard cryptographic hash function with  64 byte digest.

### /* HMAC-SHA512 */
Standard cryptographic message authentication function returning a 64 byte MAC from a combination of a message and a key, each formatted as 1D fixed array of type `uint8_t`.

### /* BNZ */
Code for implementing arbitrary precision integer math based around a custom type (`bnz_t`) and associated functions to manipulate signed integers of arbitrary size.

The 8 bit "digits" are stored, in little endian order, in the "digits" property of `bnz_t`, formatted as a 1D dynamic array of type `uint8_t`. The number of digits is stored in the "size" property, type `size_t`. The sign is stored in the "sign" property, type `size_t`, with a zero value corresponding to positive and a non-zero value corresponding to negative.

There are basic functions to initiate, free, set, align, trim, reverse, concatenate, and resize `bnz_t` integers. When resizing to a higher number of digits, new digits are zeroed and the values of existing digits are either preserved or zeroed depending on the value of the "preserve" parameter.

The `bnz_print` function is used to write a `bnz_t` number to the screen in the specified base, optionally preceded by a specified string.

Various comparison functions are implemented, returning -1, 0, or 1 according to standard C numerical comparison rules.

Functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (quotient and remainder) are implemented, with pre-processing of signs as appropriate.

Finally, arbitrary precision implementations of the special functions of mod, mod power, and multiplicative modular inverse are implemented for use in the Secp256k1 elliptic curve math.


### /* SECP256K1 */
Elliptic curve math, built around two custom structs: "PT", comprising two `bnz_t` numbers, representing a point on Secp256k1, and "SECP256K1" representing the elliptic curve itself. The "a" and "h" parameters of the curve are included for completeness, but play no role in the  functions.

### /* BITCOIN */
Bitcoin specific functions for processing entropy, generating mnemonic phrases, seeds, private keys, chain codes, public keys, and P2PKH addresses.

### /* MENU */
Menu functions.

### /* MAIN */
Main function.
